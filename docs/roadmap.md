# Roadmap

LEADR is actively evolving based on feedback from the indie game development community and adding great new features as fast as we can. Here's what we're working on next.

## Coming Soon

**Platform Sync**
Import and synchronize with existing Steam Leaderboards and Unity Gaming Services. Migrate your established leaderboards without losing history, or run LEADR alongside platform-specific boards for expanded functionality. Unify your player data across multiple platforms while maintaining compatibility with existing integrations.

**User-Generated Content Galleries**
Let players share and discover community creations. Upload custom levels, character designs, mods, or any user-generated content alongside leaderboard scores. Build browsable galleries with ratings, comments, and featured content. Turn your game into a creative community, not just a competitive one.

**Board Bounties**
Trigger automated prizes and rewards when players achieve specific milestones. Top the global leaderboard, beat a developer ghost time, or reach a target score - and automatically award Steam keys, Discord roles, in-game items, or custom webhooks. Perfect for community events, launch promotions, and keeping competition exciting.
