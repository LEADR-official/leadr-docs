# Roadmap

LEADR is actively evolving based on feedback from the indie game development community and adding great new features as fast as we can. Here's what we're working on next.

## Coming Soon

### Data Export

If you're needs change, or you just want to do some offline analysis, you can export your full LEADR data at any time.

### Ghosts & Replays

Store and share gameplay recordings directly through LEADR. Players can download ghosts to race against top performers, study high-level strategies, or share their own achievements. Perfect for speedrunning communities, competitive multiplayer, or any game where "show, don't tell" matters. Store replay metadata alongside scores and retrieve them when needed.

### Invite-Only Leaderboards

Create private boards for closed beta testing, streamer subscriber competitions, or exclusive community events. Control exactly who can submit scores while keeping the competitive experience intact. Perfect for pre-launch testing or building VIP experiences for your most dedicated players.

### Score Analytics

Understand how players interact with your game through score distribution analytics. See where players struggle, identify difficulty spikes, and make data-driven decisions about balancing and progression. Analytics help you tune difficulty curves, adjust scoring systems, and build better player experiences based on real gameplay data.

### Platform Sync
Import and synchronize with existing Steam Leaderboards and Unity Gaming Services. Migrate your established leaderboards without losing history, or run LEADR alongside platform-specific boards for expanded functionality. Unify your player data across multiple platforms while maintaining compatibility with existing integrations.

### User-Generated Content Galleries
Let players share and discover community creations. Upload custom levels, character designs, mods, or any user-generated content alongside leaderboard scores. Build browsable galleries with ratings, comments, and featured content. Turn your game into a creative community, not just a competitive one.

### Board Bounties
Trigger automated prizes and rewards when players achieve specific milestones. Top the global leaderboard, beat a developer ghost time, or reach a target score - and automatically award Steam keys, Discord roles, in-game items, or custom webhooks. Perfect for community events, launch promotions, and keeping competition exciting.
