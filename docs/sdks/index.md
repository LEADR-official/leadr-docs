# SDKs

Software Development Kits (SDKs) are native libraries for your game engine or programming language that make integrating LEADR straightforward. Instead of making raw HTTP requests, SDKs provide idiomatic APIs that feel natural in your development environmentwhether you're working in C# for Unity, GDScript for Godot, or C++ for Unreal. If you're using plugins, libraries or code assets that someone else made inside your game engine, you already know how to use a LEADR SDK.

## Getting Started

- **[Quick Start Guide](../quick_start.md)** - Integration walkthrough

## SDKs (Coming soon)

- **[Godot](https://godotengine.org)** - GDScript SDK for Godot Engine
- **[Unity](https://unity.com)** - C# SDK for Unity Engine

## Planned SDKs

We're building native SDKs for the most popular game engines and platforms. SDKs are being developed in priority order based on indie game developer usage:

- **[Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com)** - C++ SDK for Unreal Engine
- **[GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io)** - GML SDK for GameMaker
- **Lua/Defold/LOVE2D** - For games written in Lua or Lua-based game engines like Defold or LOVE2D
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - For web games and Node.js backends
- **Python** - For game servers and tools
- **C++** - Standalone C++ library for custom engines
- **C#** - Standalone .NET library
